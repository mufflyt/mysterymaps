# State-Level Choropleth Map of Acceptance Rates

Draws a CONUS (or full US) choropleth of per-state appointment
acceptance rates using ggplot2, maps, and viridis. Binary 0/1 outcome
columns are aggregated to per-state means automatically; columns already
containing rates (0-1) are used directly.

## Usage

``` r
mysterymaps_geographic_map(
  data,
  state_col = "state",
  outcome_col = "offered",
  fill_label = "Acceptance rate",
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL,
  palette = c("viridis", "magma", "plasma", "inferno", "cividis"),
  direction = 1L,
  low_states_warn = 5L,
  na_color = "grey80",
  include_alaska_hawaii = FALSE,
  labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  data.frame. Must contain at least `state_col` and `outcome_col`.

- state_col:

  Character. Column containing state abbreviations (e.g. `"CO"`, `"CA"`)
  or full state names (e.g. `"Colorado"`). Default `"state"`.

- outcome_col:

  Character. Column containing either binary 0/1 outcomes or
  per-observation acceptance rates (0-1 numeric). Default `"offered"`.

- fill_label:

  Character. Legend title shown on the fill scale. Default
  `"Acceptance rate"`.

- title:

  Character or `NULL`. Plot title. Default `NULL`.

- subtitle:

  Character or `NULL`. Plot subtitle. Default `NULL`.

- palette:

  Character. Viridis color palette. One of `"viridis"`, `"magma"`,
  `"plasma"`, `"inferno"`, or `"cividis"`. Default `"viridis"`.

- direction:

  Integer. Viridis scale direction: `1` (low color = low value; default)
  or `-1` (reversed).

- low_states_warn:

  Integer. Issue a
  [`base::warning()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/warning.html) for any state
  with fewer than this many non-missing observations. Default `5L`.

- na_color:

  Character. Fill color for states not present in `data`. Default
  `"grey80"`.

- include_alaska_hawaii:

  Logical. When `FALSE` (default), Alaska (`AK`) and Hawaii (`HI`) are
  dropped before aggregation and mapping, producing a standard CONUS
  choropleth.

- labels:

  `function(1)`. Formatter applied to the fill legend's break labels,
  passed straight through to
  [`ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html)`(labels = )`.
  Default
  [`scales::percent_format()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/percent_format.html)`(accuracy = 1)`,
  correct only when `outcome_col` is a proportion on `[0, 1]` – an
  acceptance *rate*, which is what this function was built for. A column
  that is already a rate *per* something (midwives per 1,000 births,
  cases per 100,000) is not a proportion, and the percent formatter
  renders it as nonsense: 10.79 becomes "1 000%". Pass a formatter that
  matches the column instead, e.g. `function(x) sprintf("%.0f", x)`.

## Value

A `ggplot` object of class `c("gg", "ggplot")`, returned invisibly.
Print or assign the return value to display the map.

## State identifier format

The function detects whether `state_col` contains abbreviations or full
names by sampling the first non-missing value. When the value is two
characters or fewer it is treated as an abbreviation and looked up in
[datasets::state.abb](https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/state.html) /
[datasets::state.name](https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/state.html). Longer
values are lower-cased and joined directly to the map polygon data. DC
and US territories are not present in the built-in datasets and will
appear as no-data states.

## Outcome aggregation

When every non-missing value in `outcome_col` is exactly 0 or 1, the
column is treated as binary and aggregated to a per-state acceptance
rate via [`base::tapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tapply.html)
(`mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)`). Any other numeric column is also averaged per
state, so passing a pre-computed rate works as expected.

  subtitle = "Mystery-caller study, n = 300 calls"
)
